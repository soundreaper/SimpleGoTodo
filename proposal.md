### Proposal

Making a simple backend using Golang, MySQL, GORM, Gorilla/MUX, Logrus for a todo list
web application. The frontend source code is from https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo and
features a simple frontend build using JS, HTML, and CSS. The frontend executes AJAX requests
to localhost:8000.
